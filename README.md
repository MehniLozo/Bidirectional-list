Bi-directional list that simulates CD-ROM audio functionality.
Kinda mimicking the way list of Music behaves ,where you can switch between 
a song and another using two arrows ">" "<"


Current functionalities:
    *Insert Song description in each of list cells
    *Display the whole list
    *Add all the songs from a list to another(decroissant) depending on the
    duration
    *delete a song
    *Add a song from the header of the list(expoloiting the two nodes size
        prec and suiv)
